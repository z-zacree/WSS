      The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the
      year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the
      adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the
      blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.
